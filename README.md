# PNW Dev Network Developer Directory 

## Summary
This is the repository for the PNW Dev Network Developer Directory group project. The repo is based on the AWS Amplify + Next.js starter application for building fullstack apps with AWS Amplify. 

At its most basic level, this application will provide a list of members with their preferred technologies and links to their work, with the goal of furthering collaboration among group members and providing a centralized place for people in need of developers to find qualified candidates.
